# Web Boilerplate

A boilerplate application framework for websites and web applications. With this you can quickly get new applications up and running.

## Why?

I wanted an application boilerplate for the types of applications that I like to build. The goal of this isn't to be configurable, it's simply meant to be a selection of the best current technologies to do the work that I like to do.

## Technologies

* Built on node.js
* Express.js
* Jade Templating
